### Difference between ocamlbyexample and ocaml.org cookbook

This to sites different in 2 ways:
1. ocamlbyexample will only include stuff provided by the ocaml langauge(aka stuff provided by the standard library) while ocaml.org cookbook will include third party libraries
2. the 2 websites differs in what level the expected audience have. Ocamlbyexample is suited for new ocaml developers or ocaml developers with little experience while ocaml.orgs cookbook is built for a audience that have written ocaml for a while.

### Funding
I added the ability to fund this project and currently we only help funding girlswhocode.
If the costs for servers raise will I add a funding for ocamlbyexample as well and the idea is that the funding for ocamlbyexample will be for covering costs of servers. If I gain more money then I need to pay for the servers will I donate this money to a organization that help people
